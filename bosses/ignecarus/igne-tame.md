# Igne Tame

Once you have received a Dragon Egg drop from Ignecarus, you can go about growing your own tame!

You can send the dragon tame out on PvM trips and it will get you loot.

## Hatching the Tame

In order to hatch the tame you must build a nursery with `=nursery build`.\
You will need 105 Construction along with 200 elder planks, 10 marble blocks and 500 feathers to build the nursery.&#x20;

Once the nursery is built you can then fuel the nursery with `=nursery fuel`\
Fuelling the nursery will require 2,500 elder logs and 10,000 coal.

Finally, once you have satisfied these requirements you can add your egg to the nursery with `=nursery add dragon egg`

The dragon tame will take 18.5 hours to hatch. Once hatched there is a 1/30 chance its a rare shiny dragon.

## Growth

It starts off as a baby, but grows from baby -> juvenile -> adult. At the adult stage, its the strongest. It grows up over time while doing PvM trips. You need to feed it raw food each time it goes on a trip.

When your tame hatches, their stats are decided. However, it doesnt reach its full potential until its fully grown. You can calculate what max-stats your dragon will by just multiplying the baby stats by 3 (keeping in mind rounding up/down). This stat influences how fast it does PvM trips.

You can send the dragon tame on trips with `=tame k [monster]`.

For more information on tame commands see [Tames](../../custom-items/tames.md)

## Boosts

You can feed the dragon tame certain items with `=tame feed [item]`\
