`=nex solo`\
`=nex mass`

## Gear Recommendations

_Abyssal cape is highly recommended to start out with. It significantly reduces your chance of death._

Its important to note here that the community estimates there is very little difference in death chance at higher KC's between these two setups despite the test results suggesting otherwise. 100 kills is a very small sample size in reality, however KC does play a big part and it is suggested you use tank gear to start out with.

Having a barbarian assault arrow (from untradeable mystery boxes) equipped in your ammo slot will help immensely with range attack bonus, allowing you to use more tanky gear. You will receive a speed penalty if you have less than 200 range attack bonus. 

### **Max Range Setup**

* Each kill takes - 9 Minutes and 26 Seconds.
* For 100 kills (Presuming you don't die!) - 15 Hours 43 Minutes and 19 Seconds.
* Total kills tested - 100
* Deaths - 0
* Brews used per 1kc - 10.58
* Restores used per 1kc - 1.07
