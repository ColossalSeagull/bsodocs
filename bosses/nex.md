# Nex

Nex is an endgame boss that requires 95 prayer and a Frozen Key to start. You can either Solo or Mass it and requires some high level ranged gear to fight. Its unique drops are Pernix, Torva and Virtus gear. Nex also drops a decent amount of TMB's and Grandmaster clues.\

## Gear Recommendations

_Abyssal cape is highly recommended to start out with. It significantly reduces your chance of death._

To start with Nex, we recommend to go for a gear setup with 205+ ranged attack and as high ranged defence as possible, to reduce the cost of Saradomin Brews and Super Restores. Having a barbarian assault arrow (from untradeable mystery boxes) equipped in your ammo slot will help immensely with range attack bonus, allowing you to use more tanky gear. You will receive a speed penalty if you have less than 200 range attack bonus.&#x20;



### **Max Range Setup**

* Full Gorajan Archer
* Farsight Snapshot Necklace
* Archers ring (i) or a Ring of Suffering (ri/i)
* Hellfire Bow / Zaryte Bow
* Abyssal Cape / Combatants Cape
* In a max range setup the arrow slot doesn't make any differences.
* Each kill takes - 8 Minutes and 2 Seconds.

### &#x20;Ironman setup

**Warning -** It is extremely likely you will die repeatedly with this setup but your mileage may vary. It therefore is recommended for irons to gain some kc in masses.\
