# Nex

Nex is an endgame boss that requires 95 prayer and a Frozen Key to start. You can either Solo or Mass it and requires some high level ranged gear to fight. It drops Pernix, Torva and Virtus gear.  
`=nex solo`  
`=nex mass`

## Gear Recommendations

Its important to note here that the community estimates there is very little difference in death chance at higher KC's between these two setups despite the test results suggesting otherwise. 100 kills is a very small sample size in reality, however KC does play a big part and it is suggested you use tank gear to start out with.

### **Max Range Setup**

* Each kill takes - 9 Minutes and 26 Seconds.
* For 100 kills \(Presuming you don't die!\) - 15 Hours 43 Minutes and 19 Seconds.
* Total kills tested - 100
* Deaths - 0
* Brews used per 1kc - 10.58
* Restores used per 1kc - 1.07
