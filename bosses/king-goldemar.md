King Goldemar is a boss that can be done via mass or solo. Please go to the channel \#mass-king-goldemar for more info.

Entrance fee to fight King Goldemar is 10 million but can be reduced to 5m if a Ring of Charos is equipped. 

The most coveted drop from King Goldemar is the Broken Dwarven Warhammer, which when repaired becomes the Dwarven Warhammer \(DWWH\). When equipped in any gear setup, it provides a 40% speed boost to all  =k PVM activities. This does not include Nex, Vasa Magus, Ignecarus. 

Players can equip a Ring of Luck, obtained via Grandmaster Clue Scrolls, to increase the drop rate of receiving the Broken Dwarven warhammer drop. **Note: If Participating in a mass, only 1 member of the party needs to have a Ring of Luck equipped to receive the increased drop rate.**

It is recommended to Mass for the 1st 50kc as it reduces your death chance.
