# Emerged Zuk Inferno

The **Emerged Zuk Inferno** is a new, harder version of the Inferno, where Zuk emerges from the lava, and engages you in a melee fight, and you have to truly kill him in his final form, to win. This is endgame, high-level, costly content, which has heavy requirements, but some very exclusive rewards, which are untradeable.



You can do it using: `=i start --emerged or =i start --em`



## Requirements

* All the normal inferno requirements.
* 20 Normal Inferno KC
* Elder Barrage runes (Elder runes, Blood runes, Death runes)
* Heat res. brews and Heat res. restores; _When Zuk emerges from the lava, lava is splashed and thrown everywhere, which would melt any glass potions, you still need normal brews/restores for before this point though, the heat res is only for the final fight_
* Hellfire bow, Dragon arrows and Hellfire arrows; _You need Dragon arrows for the pre-emerged stage, and Hellfire arrows for the final emerged fight. You equip the Dragon arrows, and keep the Hellfire arrows banked._
* Full Pernix (or full gorajan archer), and a farsight snapshot necklace, in your range outfit
* Full Virtus (or full gorajan occult), and a arcane blast necklace, and a virtus wand, in your mage outfit.
