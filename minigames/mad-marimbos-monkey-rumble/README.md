# Mad Marimbo's Monkey Rumble

Monkey Rumble is a minigame where you wear a greegree to turn into a monkey, and then _fight_ other monkeys/gorillas! You will gain Strength, Agility and Defence XP, as well as some unique rewards.

### Quickstart Guide

1. `=buy m'speak amulet`
2. `=equip misc m'speak amulet`
3. `=mr buy beginner rumble greegree`
4. `=equip misc beginner rumble greegree`
5. Make sure you have some fruit, for your monkey-form to eat!
6. `=mr start`

* You need a m'speak amulet \(`=buy` it\), and a rumble greegree to compete. You start off buying a Beginner rumble greegree, and after doing more games, you unlock higher greegrees.
* Higher greegrees \(monkey tiers\) increase XP and chances of unique rewards, the XP you get scales off your monkey tier AND your strength level.
* You need food for the fights, but as you're fighting in your monkey form, you can only eat fruits. All of them act as equal amount of healing, except lychee/mango/avocado give a special speed boost when using them.
* When doing fights, you will fight random monkeys, there are over 20,000+ possible monkeys you can fight. At a rare chance, you'll fight a special monkey.
* Special monkeys have purple names and different appearances, and _they_ are the ones who give you the unique rewards after fighting them.
* You also earn Rumble tokens, the reward currency of this minigame, which you can spend on some rewards, if you have all the rewards, you can spend them on Monkey crates.
* Monkey rumble has a collection log, `=cl mr`

### Rewards

**Monkey Egg \(which hatches into the new Monkey Tame\)**

* The biggest reward, is the rare Monkey Egg, which is given to you by special monkeys in fights.
* Upon getting a Monkey Egg, you can put it in your nursery, hatch it - and it will grow over time from a baby -&gt; juvenile -&gt; adult.
* The Monkey tame, does collecting for you! Like the `=collect` command, you can send your monkey tame off to go collect items. e.g. `=t c blue dragon scales`
* A baby monkey is equivalent to the collecting speed of a minion, an adult monkey can get over 3x faster, with the 2 fed item boosts!
* Feeding your baby monkey a _Zak_ will give it 35 minutes longer trip length.
* Feeding it a Voidling and a Ring of endurance will each give your monkey a 10% speed increase.
