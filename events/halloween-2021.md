Four human pieces (those being the sliced femur, human blood, human tooth, and human appendage) can be found while doing farming trips at a rate of one in four, upon which the trip return message will have an attached phrase which can vary.

Currently the Halloween pet, Gregoyle, can be found while killing gargoyles when the user has at least one Choc'rock in their bank. The pet has a small chance to appear on a trip when a Choc'rock is consumed. The current observed average to get the pet is five Choc'rocks consumed, however no official rates have been provided.
