# Hunter

#### Elder Birdhouses

Elder Birdhouses can be set at level 99 Hunter, giving random seeds and a chance at [Grandmaster Clues](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/custom-items/grandmaster-clues).

**Sand Geckos**

Sand Geckos can be hunted at 120 hunter, requiring simple kibble to catch them. They reward various mystery boxes, and can be boosted using [Sandy](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/custom-items/pets) and the Master Hunter Cape (500m XP)

### Optimal Experience

The highest hunter experience rates are obtained by hunting Black Chinchompas. It is recommended to have a black d'hide body and chaps equipped in the wilderness setup for a cheap method of lowering your chance of dying on your trips. It is also recommended to have a sandy equipped to receive extra loot. When you have a hunter master cape, you will catch twice as many Chinchompas, as well as receiving a 10% boost from experience in catching Chinchompas when you have caught enough. You will receive rates of roughly 1.4m xp/h.
