# Smithing

### Custom Items

* [Blacksmith Equipment](../custom-items/equippables.md#blacksmith-equipment)
* [Zak](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/custom-items/pets)
* [Takon](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/custom-items/pets)

#### Dwarven Ore

The ore is dropped by [King Goldemar](../bosses/king-goldemar.md#loot) and is used to smith dwarven bars which are used to make a variety of [Dwarven Equipment](../custom-items/equippables.md#dwarven-equipment).

Requirements:

* 99 Smithing
* Klik
* 20 coal per dwarven ore

_Note: There is a 35% chance to fail smelting the bar. The ore is used up in the attempt. This is halved if you have a Smithing Master Cape._&#x20;

### Optimal Experience

The fastest experience is obtained while wearing full Blacksmith Equipment, using Takon (You should **not** have the Dwarven Greathammer equipped as it takes priority to Takon, and provides a slightly smaller boost), and smithing Rune Platebodies, where you can obtain roughly 3.2m xp/h.
