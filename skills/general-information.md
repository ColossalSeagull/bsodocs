# General Information

All xp in BSO is granted a 5x boost from OSB/OSRS rates.

### Global Boosts

There are five extremely rare items called 1st age that each boost all xp gains by 1% with an additional 1% added if you have all 5 equipped.

Having any master cape (achieved from having 500m xp in a skill and spending 1b gp) equipped anywhere will give a global 3% boost to all xp gained. This goes up to 8% when training the skill you have mastery in.

All rates described in this wiki are shown without these global boosts
