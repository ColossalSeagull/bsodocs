# Crafting

### Custom Items

* [Dwarven Greathammer](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/custom-items/equippables#dwarven-equipment) - 2x Crafting Speed
* Crafting Master Cape - Currently perkless
* Klik - Provides extremely increased speeds when tanning (Do not use in conjunction with the Dwarven Greathammer, as it will override the pet perk)

### Optimal Experience

The current fastest training method for crafting is to craft Royal Dragonhide Bodies while you have a Dwarven Greathammer equipped, which will give you roughly 4.3m xp/h.
