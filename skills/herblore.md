# Herblore

### Custom Items

Heat res. potions

1. Create Athelas paste from crushing the Athelas herb. `=mix athelas paste`
2. Craft Heat res. vials with molten glass and athelas paste. `=craft heat res. vial`
3. Mix a Super antifire, 4-dose brew/restore into the heat res. vial. E.g. `=mix heat res. brew`.

The Herblore Master Cape, and Dragon's Fury (a potion made at 120 herblore using 2 Ignecarus Scales and 1 Abyssal Dragon Bones) are also custom to BSO.&#x20;

### Optimal Experience

The fastest experience rates are obtained through making Heat Res. Brews , which are unlocked at level 105 Herblore. You can make roughly 3m xp/h with these rates. An alternative, experimental method, is to make Dragon's Fury potions, where the rates are roughly 14.6m xp/h.
