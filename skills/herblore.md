# Herblore

### Custom Items

Heat res. potions

1. Create Athelas paste from crushing the Athelas herb. `=mix athelas paste`
2. Craft Heat res. vials with molten glass and athelas paste. `=craft heat res. vial`
3. Mix a Super antifire, 4-dose brew/restore into the heat res. vial. E.g. `=mix heat res. brew`.

The Herblore Master Cape, and Dragon's Fury (a potion made at 120 herblore using 2 Ignecarus Scales and 1 Abyssal Dragon Bones) are also custom to BSO.&#x20;

### Optimal Experience

The fastest experience rates are obtained through making Super Combat potions, which are unlocked at level 90 Herblore. An alternative, experimental method, is to make Dragon's Fury potions, where the rates are supposedly the highest. It is highly recommended to have a lot of spare cash to dump for this skill, as Super Combat potions are currently **useless**, and Dragon's Fury potions are rarely used, and when used, only one is needed.
