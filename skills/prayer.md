# Prayer

You can train Prayer by burying bones, or offering them to the Chaos altar. For example to bury 100 Dragon bones, you can do `=bury 100 Dragon bones`, or to bury the maximum amount you can: `=bury Dragon bones`.

Offering the bones to the Chaos altar works exactly the same, except you use `=offer` instead, for example: `=offer 100 Dragon bones`.

The Chaos Altar works like in-game, your minion will do 1 inventory trips back and forth to sacrifice, with a 10% chance of being PKed in the trip and losing some amount of your inventory of bones \(depending on if you got PKed at the start/middle/finish\).  

### Optimal Prayer

It is recommended to offer dragon bones up until level 70 when you unlock the ability to offer superior dragon bones up until level 99. If going for the Prayer master skill cape, it is recommended to use abyssal dragon bones until the necessary 500m xp total.

Usage of the custom pet, Lil Lamb, is very useful to speed up the process of gaining prayer xp. The perk of Lil Lamb is to boost XP from offering bones by 1x-3x multiplier. 

**Note:** When going for 500m xp, please use `=m lvl prayer`to determine how much xp you have gained after each trip as the trip report may be inaccurate in displaying your full xp gained per trip.

### Master Skill Cape

The Prayer master skill cape is a BSO - exclusive cape that provides an 8% XP boost when training prayer, and 3% XP boost if training any other skill. A prayer master skillcape can be purchased using `=skillcape prayer master cape`  and will cost 1 billion gp.

Note: A master skill cape must be equipped in any of your gear setups in order for the XP boost to take effect. 

Perk: 40% Less Prayer Potions consumed when using Dwarven Blessing

  
Note: Master cape perks do not currently include the original skill cape's perks, so you must equip both in different gear setups to get the effects of both.
