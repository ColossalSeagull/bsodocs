# Dungeoneering

### Starting Out

There are 1-7 floors. Each floor requires +20 DG levels, and increasingly higher stats in other skills, especially combat.

`=dg start [floor]` to start training dungeoneering. The floor is optional to provide. You can only do a floor for which you have the required stats, it will automatically pick the highest floor you can do.

`=dg buy [name]` to buy a reward.

`=dg` to see your tokens and max floor.

While doing dungeoneering in dungeons of Floor 5+, you have a chance of getting a tradeable Gorajan shard. You can combine 2 of these with a nex armor piece to make a gorajan armor piece, using smithing. (see [Dungeoneering Rewards](dg-rewards.md)).

### Boosts

You get boosts to your dungeoneering speed from: dung cape OR master dung cape, scroll of teleportation, and gorajan armor. You get negative boosts (slower) from doing solo or duo dungeons. You receive less XP if doing a floor lower than your max floor.

Dungeoneering boosts, excluding party size, are divided by the number of players in the mass.

#### Ring of Luck (Individual)

* Ring of luck - 5% more likely to find gorajan shards
* Master Dungeoneering Cape - 2x

### Optimal Experience

The best way to train dungeoneering is to lamp to either 100, from which you do floor 6 to 120 (or you can lamp to 120 to skip extra grinding, but it is **very** expensive.) When you reach 120, you can do floor 7 for optimal rates.

#### Dungeoneering

* Gorajan armour - 6% per completed set
* Party Size - 5% for every person in a mass starting from a party of 2 to a limit of 25%
* Scroll of Teleportation - 15% (20% with Dungeoneering Cape)
