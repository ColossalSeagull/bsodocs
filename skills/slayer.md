# Slayer

Slayer on BSO is nearly identical to OSB. Some key differences -&#x20;

* Scroll of longevity - Obtained from dungeoneering, doubles length of tasks. <mark style="color:red;">WARNING: Once this is enabled it CANNOT be disabled. It's recommended that you build up a reasonable amount of points before using this.</mark>
* Slayer master cape - Gives 2x superior rolls.
