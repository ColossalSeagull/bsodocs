# Slayer

### Slayer Unlocks

There are several slayer unlocks, but only a handful of them are particular to BSO, so only these will be covered.

Infernal Slayer Helm - Provides a +3% boost on task (+7% when imbued) and is obtained from the [Emerged Zuk Inferno](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/emerged-zuk-inferno)

Scroll of Longevity - Obtained through Dungeoneering, doubles the length of slayer tasks

Size Matters - Doubles the length of slayer tasks

Pore Decisions - Unlocks tasks within the [Polypore Dungeon](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/custom-items/custom-monsters#polypore-dungeon)

Block and Roll (5000 Slayer Points) - Allows you to block 3 extra tasks\
\


### Optimal Experience

Your block list, when aiming for optimal Slayer experience, should consist of the following: (This is assuming you have the elite Lumbridge/Draynor diary completed, and have unlocked Block and Roll. If not, then the tasks are listed in order of priority. Also note that you should **only use Konar for optimal rates**, and you can default to using him with the command `=slayertask konar --save`)

1. Cave Kraken
2. Black Demons
3. Greater Demons\*
4. Blue Dragons
5. Gargoyles
6. Drakes
7. Wyrms
8. Skeletal Wyverns
9. Spiritual Creatures

You should **always** skip the following tasks, assuming you have the points to do so:

All metal dragons, Wyverns, Mutated Zygomites, Aberrant Spectres, Cave Horrors, Ankou, Aviansies, Brine Rats, Trolls, Turoths, and Waterfiends.&#x20;

Unlock the following slayer task extensions, and also use the command `=autoslay ehp --save`:

Nechs Please, To dust you shall return, Bleed me dry, Ankou Very Much\*, Augment my Abbies

Once you have done this, you should have the following equipment for maximum boosts:

Dwarven Warhammer, Dwarven Blessing, Amulet of Zealots, A full cannon set (=buy dwarf cannon) with cannonballs to use on task, and an imbued slayer helm of any kind.

Having this blocklist alongside these specific unlocks and the previously listed boosts will allow you to reach very high (very volatile) xp rates.&#x20;

\*This is assuming you have a Hellfire Bow equipped in your wilderness setup. If you have a Hellfire Bow, you should always do Fire Giant and Ankou tasks due to the bonus provided by the Hellfire Bow.&#x20;

With all of these steps in place, one can expect to receive a rough average of 3m xp/h.
