# Slayer

### Slayer Unlocks

There are several slayer unlocks, but only a handful of them are particular to BSO, so only these will be covered.

Infernal Slayer Helm - Provides a +3% boost on task (+7% when imbued) and is obtained from the [Emerged Zuk Inferno](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/emerged-zuk-inferno)

Scroll of Longevity - Obtained through Dungeoneering, doubles the length of slayer tasks

Size Matters - Doubles the length of slayer tasks

Block and Roll (5000 Slayer Points) - Allows you to block 3 extra tasks

### Optimal Experience

Your block list, when aiming for optimal Slayer experience, should consist of the following: (This is assuming you have the elite Lumbridge/Draynor diary completed, and have unlocked Block and Roll. If not, then the tasks are listed in order of priority. Also note that you should **only use Duradel for optimal rates**, and you can default to using him with the command `=slayertask duradel --save`)

1. Cave Kraken
2. Black Demons
3. Abyssal Demons
4. Blue Dragons
5. Gargoyles
6. Drakes
7. Wyrms
8. Skeletal Wyverns
9. Spiritual Creatures

You should **always** skip the following tasks, assuming you have the points to do so:

Steel Dragons, Iron Dragons, Fossil Island Wyverns, Mutated Zygomites, Aberrant Spectres, Cave Horrors, Ankou, and Waterfiends.&#x20;

Unlock the following slayer task extensions, and also use the command `=autoslay ehp --save`:

Nechs Please, To dust you shall return, Bleed me dry

Once you have done this, you should have the following equipment for maximum boosts:

Dwarven Warhammer, Dwarven Blessing, Amulet of Zealots, A full cannon set (=buy dwarf cannon) with cannonballs to use on task, and an imbued slayer helm of any kind.

Having this blocklist alongside these specific unlocks and the previously listed boosts will allow you to reach very high (very volatile) xp rates.&#x20;
