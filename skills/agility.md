# Agility

## Training Meta

Currently, the best way to train agility is to do the highest level agility course that is available at your agility level. Refer to the osb wiki or the official osrs wiki for more info.

Once you reach lvl 101 agility you should do the Daemonheim agility course provided you have purchased the [Daemonheim agility pass](dungeoneering-training/dg-rewards.md#miscellaneous-buyables) from Dungeoneering.

Note: If you have a [Cob](../custom-items/pets.md#discontinued-pets), the fastest experience will be the Hallowed Sepulchre.

## BSO Specific Content

* Daemonheim agility course - Roughly 1.3m xp an hour and chance to find dungeoneering dyes and gorajan shards
* Monkey Rumble - While doing this minigame you can receive agility experience at about 1/4th of the strength xp you receive.

## Boosts

* Cob - 2x speed boost at Hallowed Supulchre
* Harry - Increases mark of grace rate and eliminates level-scaling for marks of grace
