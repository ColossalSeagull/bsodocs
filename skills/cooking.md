# Cooking

### Custom Items

* [Remy ](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/custom-items/pets)- 2x Cooking Speed
* Dwarven Gauntlets - 2x Cooking Speed
* Cooked Rocktail - Cookable at 120 cooking

### Optimal Experience

The best experience rates for Cooking are obtained while cooking Rocktails with a Remy equipped (You should **not** have Dwarven Gauntlets equipped as they take priority to Remy, and provide a slightly less boost). You can receive rates of roughly 3.3m xp/h with this method.
