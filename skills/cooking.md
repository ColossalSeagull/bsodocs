# Cooking

### Custom Items

* [Remy ](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/custom-items/pets)- 2x Cooking Speed
* Dwarven Gauntlets - 3x Cooking Speed
* Cooked Rocktail - Cookable at 120 cooking

### Optimal Experience

The best experience rates for Cooking are obtained while cooking Rocktails with a Remy equipped (You should **not** have Remy equipped as it takes priority to the gauntlets, and provides a slightly less boost). You can receive rates of roughly 4.56m xp/h with this method.
