### Optimal Experience

The best experience rates for Cooking are obtained while cooking Rocktails with Dwarven Gauntlets equipped (You should **not** have Remy equipped as it takes priority to the gauntlets, and provides a slightly less boost). You can receive rates of roughly 4.56m xp/h with this method.
