# Grandmaster Clues

### Prerequisites 

To complete a grandmaster clue, you must have the clue scroll in your bank, as well as have completed 100 master clues, which can easily be done by buying 100 master caskets and opening them.

### Strategy

The most commonly used strategy to solve grandmaster clues is equipping full [clue hunter](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/custom-items/equippables#clue-hunter-outfit), graceful, the Achievement Diary Cape, and [Zippy](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/custom-items/pets#resource-gathering-and-loot-effecting-pets). This gives the maximum amount of boosts (not including clue score from completing grandmaster clues, which is roughly 60 clues completed for the full 10% boost.) totaling 30%.
