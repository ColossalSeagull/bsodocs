#### Dwarven Armor

Dwarven armor is smithable from Dwarven Bars with 120 Smithing and is also dropped by King Goldemar \(see [King Goldemar](../bosses/king-goldemar.md)\). It currently provides no boosts to content but provides high crush defence.

| :--- | :--- |
| Dwarven Full Helm | 2 |
| Dwarven Platebody | 5 |
| Dwarven Platelegs | 4 |
| Dwarven Boots | 2 |
| Dwarven Gloves | 2 |

#### Other Dwarven Gear

These dwarven gear are unlike the previous in that they are not smithable from Dwarven bars and instead are rare drops.

**Dwarven Warhammer**: Rare drop from King Goldemar \(see [King Goldemar](../bosses/king-goldemar.md)\) and provides a 40% PvM boost. Drops as a **Broken Dwarven Warhammer** and must be fixed, requiring 120 Smithing, Blacksmith's Outfit, and Dwarven Bars.

**Dwarven Blessing**: Rare drop from Grandmaster Caskets \(see [Misc](misc.md)\) and provides a 20% boost to PvM \(25% with Amulet of Zealots\). Consumes 1 Prayer Potion per 5 minutes of PvM \(reduced by 40% with Prayer Master Cape\).

### Abyssal Equipment

Abyssal equipment can be obtained by killing [Malygos](../bosses/malygos.md). 

* Abyssal Cape - Provides an aura which reduces food consumption by 50%
* Dragon Hunter Lance - Provides a large boost against dragons \(varies\)

### Nex Equipment

The following items can be obtained by killing Nex \(see [Nex](../bosses/nex.md)\). These items all have very high bonuses in their respective style, Pernix - range, Torva - melee, and Virtus - magic. 

* **Pernix**: Cowl, Body, Chaps, Gloves, Boots
* **Torva**: Full Helm, Platebody, Platelegs, Gloves, Boots
* **Virtus**: Hood, Rob Top, Robe Legs, Gloves, Boots, Wand Book

These items can also be upgraded \(except for Virtus Wand and Book\) using Gorajan Shards to make Gorajan Armor.

Additionally, the **Zaryte** **Bow** is also obtainable as a drop. It provides the highest range attack and strength bonus of any bow and gives a 20% boost to Nex.

### Drygore Weapons

Drygore weapons are a drop from the Kalphite King \(see [Kalphite King](../bosses/kalphite-king.md)\). Each type of weapon has a main hand and offhand pair. 

### Dungeoneering Gear

There are various types of gear that can be obtained from Dungeoneering \(see [Dungeoneering](../skills/dungeoneering-training/dg-rewards.md)\). 

### Clue Hunter Outfit

The Clue Hunter outfit can be obtained as a rare drop from Grandmaster Caskets \(see [Misc](misc.md)\). Previously it was obtainable from the Crack the Clue event. It gives a 2x speed boost to completing clues and increases Grandmaster Clue drop rate from Master caskets. 

* Helm of Raedwald
* Clue Hunter Cloak
* Clue Hunter Garb
* Clue Hunter Trousers
* Clue Hunter Boots
* Clue Hunter Gloves

### Master Farmer Outfit

The Master Farmer outfit is craftable with 110 Crafting using Ent hides dropped from Treebeard \(see [Bosses]()\). The outfit gives +3 extra maximum patches, for every type of patch. This stacks with the +2 patches from the Scroll of farming. It does not have to be equipped.

| Piece | Ent Hide Needed |
| :--- | :--- |
| Master Farmer Hat | 1 |
| Master Farmer Jacket | 3 |
| Master Farmer Pants | 2 |
| Master Farmer Boots | 1 |
| Master Farmer Gloves | 1 |

### Master Capes

Master capes are skillcapes that can be purchased upon getting 500M XP in the respective skill. The command to purchase a master cape is `=skillcape hunter master cape` for example. Each one costs 1b gp to purchase and is untradeable. A master cape will provide 8% XP boost if training the corresponding skill, or 3% when training any other skill. This perk is global, and the master cape can be equipped in any gear tab to receive the XP boost. Master capes also have the same stats as an Abyssal Cape without the food reduction perk. 

Additionally, master capes have a perk that is related to the skill that they are corresponding to. Skills with missing perks are either yet to be added or still unknown.
