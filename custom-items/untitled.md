# Equippables

In BSO, there are various types of custom weapons and armor that have good stats or give bonuses at various activities.

### Dwarven Equipment

#### Dwarven Tools

The dwarven tools are smithed from Dwarven Bars \(smelted from dwarven ore, see [Misc](misc.md)\).

#### Dwarven Armor

Dwarven armor is smithable from Dwarven Bars with 120 Smithing and is also dropped by King Goldemar \(see [Bosses](bosses.md)\). It currently provides no boosts to content but provides high crush defence.

| Armor Piece | Bars Needed |
| :--- | :--- |
| Dwarven Full Helm | 2 |
| Dwarven Platebody | 5 |
| Dwarven Platelegs | 4 |
| Dwarven Boots | 2 |
| Dwarven Gloves | 2 |

#### Other Dwarven Gear

These dwarven gear are unlike the previous in that they are not smithable from Dwarven bars and instead are rare drops.

**Dwarven Warhammer**: Rare drop from King Goldemar \(see [Bosses](bosses.md)\) and provides a 40% PvM boost. Drops as a **Broken Dwarven Warhammer** and must be fixed, requiring 120 Smithing, Blacksmith's Outfit, and Dwarven Bars.

**Dwarven Blessing**: Rare drop from Grandmaster Caskets \(see [Misc](misc.md)\) and provides a 20% boost to PvM \(25% with Amulet of Zealots\). Consumes 1 Prayer Potion per 5 minutes of PvM \(reduced by 40% with Prayer Master Cape\).

### Abyssal Equipment

### Nex Equipment

### Dungeoneering Gear

### Clue Hunter Outfit

### Master Farmer Outfit

### Master Capes

Master capes are skillcapes that can be purchased upon getting 500M XP in the respective skill. The command to purchase a master cape is `=skillcape hunter master cape` for example. Each one costs 1b gp to purchase and is untradeable. A master cape will provide 8% XP boost if training the corresponding skill, or 3% when training any other skill. This perk is global, and the master cape can be equipped in any gear tab to receive the XP boost. Master capes also have the same stats as an Abyssal Cape without the food reduction perk. 

Additionally, master capes have a perk that is related to the skill that they are corresponding to. Skills with missing perks are either yet to be added or still unknown.
