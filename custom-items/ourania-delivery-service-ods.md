# Ourania Delivery Service \(ODS\)

The ODS is like the Gnome Restaurant, except instead of delivering food, you craft runes and then deliver them to Wizards in need.

It's a pretty simple activity to do, the only requirement is that you have Pure essence to craft the runes with.

 You can start a trip using `=ods start`

After finishing deliveries, you'll get Runecraft XP and Ourania tokens. The tokens can be spent on a few rewards. You can buy rewards using tokens with `=ods buy [name]`.

## Requirements

* Lots of pure essence 
* 55-100 Elder runes per kill
* Decent mage gear

## Gear

You don't need any gear.

## Loot

You get Runecraft XP and Ourania tokens, you get more of both at higher RC levels. These are the things you can buy with the tokens:

* **Master runecrafter hat/robe/skirt/boots/gloves:** Gives 10% bonus XP when Runecrafting
* **Elder thread:** Can be used to upgrade an Abyssal pouch to make it carry significantly more essence, which hugely increases Runecraft XP/hr.
* **Elder talisman:** Allows you to be able to runecraft Elder runes, if it's in your bank. Crafting Elder runes is the best Runecraft XP/hr.
