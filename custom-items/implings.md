# Implings

On top of the regular implings you can get, there are 3 more you can get in BSO:

**Infernal Impling:** \(requires 94 hunter\) Drops tzhaar-related items, 1 in 1 million chance of Uncut onyx

**Chimpling:** \(requires 95 hunter and a magical banana\) It drops &lt;to be filled out&gt;

**Eternal impling:** \(requires 99 hunter\) Drops magic-related items \(staves, runes, orbs\) and grandmaster clues. 1 in 1 million chance of Eternal crystal. Eternal implings use magic to make themselves invisible to hide, you can only see/get them if you're wearing a Vasa cloak in one of your setups.

**Mystery impling:** \(requires 105 hunter\) Drops a tradeable/untradeable/pet/equippable mystery box, always drops a grandmaster clue, and has a 1 in 1 million chance of dropping another mystery impling from within itself.

You can view the collection log for implings with `=cl implings`.
