# Implings

Ontop of the regular implings you can get, there are 3 more you can get in BSO:

**Infernal Impling;** drops tzhaar-related items, 1 in 1 million chance of Uncut onyx

**Eternal impling;** drops magic-related items \(staves, runes, orbs\) and grandmaster clues. 1 in 1 million chance of Eternal crystal.

**Mystery impling;** drops a tradeable/untradeable/pet/equippable mystery box, always drops a grandmaster clue, and a 1 in 1 million chance of dropping another mystery impling from within itself.
