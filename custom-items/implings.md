# Implings

On top of the regular implings you can get, there are 3 more you can get in BSO:

**Infernal Impling: **(requires 94 hunter) Drops tzhaar-related items, 1 in 1 million chance of Uncut onyx

**Chimpling: **(requires 95 hunter and a magical banana) It drops Shiny monkey nuts at a 1 in 1 million chance, seeds, TMB's, GM's and the very rare monkey egg.\
Magical banana's are consumed upon catch and can be obtained by casting the `=enchant banana` spell. You can obtain this spell from the [Monkey Rumble minigame](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/mad-marimbos-monkey-rumble).

**Eternal impling: **(requires 99 hunter) Drops magic-related items (staves, runes, orbs) and grandmaster clues. 1 in 1 million chance of Eternal crystal. Eternal implings use magic to make themselves invisible to hide, you can only see/get them if you have a Vasa cloak in your bank or equipped.

**Mystery impling: **(requires 105 hunter) Drops a tradeable/untradeable/pet/equippable mystery box, always drops a grandmaster clue, and has a 1 in 1 million chance of dropping another mystery impling from within itself.
