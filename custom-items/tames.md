# Tames

A tame is a special form of pet that isn't in your bank or equipped. You can send the tame out on trips.

Every tame has certain stats associated with it: combat, artisan, gatherer, support.\
Items that your tames get will not be added to your collection log.

**Currently the only tames that are in game are:**\
The dragon tame which only does combat, see [Igne Tame](../bosses/ignecarus/igne-tame.md).\
The Monkey tame which collects secondaries, see [Monkey Tame](../minigames/mad-marimbos-monkey-rumble/monkey-tame.md).

## Hatching the Tame

In order to hatch the tame you must build a nursery with `=nursery build`.\
You will need 105 Construction along with 200 elder planks, 10 marble blocks and 500 feathers to build the nursery.&#x20;

Once the nursery is built you can then fuel the nursery with `=nursery fuel`\
Fuelling the nursery will require 2,500 elder logs and 10,000 coal.

Finally, once you have satisfied these requirements you can add your egg to the nursery i.e.`=nursery add dragon egg`

Note: The ring of luck provides a 3% boost to the chance that on hatch the tame will be a shiny.

## Merging Tames

&#x20;A tame can be merged using the following command: `=t merge x y` where x represents the tame you to merge into, and y represents the tame that will be destroyed in the process.&#x20;

Both tames **must** be adults, and **there is no way to revert this.**&#x20;

When a tame is merged, all of the following will be kept:&#x20;

* All items fed to either tame&#x20;
* All items collected by either tame&#x20;
* The stats of both tames will be merged, keeping the highest of both tames&#x20;

To merge two Igne tames, you must have 110 Runecraft, 110 Magic, and 110 Herblore, and it will cost 100 Ignecarus scales, 6 Zenyte, 10 Onyx, 1 Draconic Visage, 2500 Soul Runes, 600 Astral Runes, and 100 Elder Runes. There is a 10 million coin fee for merging tames.\
