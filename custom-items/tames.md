# Tames

A tame is a special form of pet that isn't in your bank or equipped. You can send the tame out on trips.

Every tame has certain stats associated with it: combat, artisan, gatherer, support.  
Items that your tames get will not be added to your collection log.

**Currently the only tames that are in game are:**  
The dragon tame which only does combat, see [Igne Tame](../bosses/ignecarus/igne-tame.md).  
The Monkey tame which collects secondaries, see [Monkey Tame](../minigames/mad-marimbos-monkey-rumble/monkey-tame.md).

## Hatching the Tame

In order to hatch the tame you must build a nursery with `=nursery build`.  
You will need 105 Construction along with 200 elder planks, 10 marble blocks and 500 feathers to build the nursery. 

Once the nursery is built you can then fuel the nursery with `=nursery fuel`  
Fuelling the nursery will require 2,500 elder logs and 10,000 coal.

Finally, once you have satisfied these requirements you can add your egg to the nursery with `=nursery add dragon egg`

## Merging Tames

 A tame can be merged using the following command: `=t merge x y` where x represents the tame you to merge into, and y represents the tame that will be destroyed in the process. 

Both tames **must** be adults, and **there is no way to revert this.** 

When a tame is merged, all of the following will be kept: 

* All items fed to either tame 
* All items collected by either tame 
* The stats of both tames will be merged, keeping the highest of both tames 

To merge two tames, you must have 110 Runecraft, 110 Magic, and 110 Herblore, and it will cost 100 Ignecarus scales, 2 Zenyte, 2500 Soul Runes, and 100 Elder Runes.
