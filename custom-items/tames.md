# Tames

A tame is a special form of pet that isn't in your bank or equipped. You can send the tame out on trips.

Every tame has certain stats associated with it: combat, artisan, gatherer, support.  
Items that your tames get will not be added to your collection log.

**Note:** Currently the only tame that is in game is the dragon tame which only does combat. See [Igne Tame](../bosses/ignecarus/igne-tame.md).
