# Tames

A tame is a special form of pet that isn't in your bank or equipped. You can send the tame out on trips.

Every tame has certain stats associated with it: combat, artisan, gatherer, support.  
Items that your tames get will not be added to your collection log.

**Currently the only tames that are in game are:**  
The dragon tame which only does combat, see [Igne Tame](../bosses/ignecarus/igne-tame.md).  
The Monkey tame &lt;which does something&gt;, see Monkey Tame.

## Hatching the Tame

In order to hatch the tame you must build a nursery with `=nursery build`.  
You will need 105 Construction along with 200 elder planks, 10 marble blocks and 500 feathers to build the nursery. 

Once the nursery is built you can then fuel the nursery with `=nursery fuel`  
Fuelling the nursery will require 2,500 elder logs and 10,000 coal.

Finally, once you have satisfied these requirements you can add your egg to the nursery with `=nursery add dragon egg`

The dragon tame will take 18.5 hours to hatch.
